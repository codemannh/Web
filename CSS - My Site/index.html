      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">I am a 30 year veteran of IT, working on multiple technologies, now working to broaden my web development skills. Recently, I was certified in ITIL Foundations and working in ITSM Continual Service Improvement. I love working in
      my yard, brewing beer and home automation.

        <h3>Problem solving</h3>
        <p>At a very young age, I would take things apart and then put them back together again - just for fun. The satisfaction of making something work correctly, even if it wasn't broken really made me happy. My parents were not always keen on that habit. Having been in technology for a long time, I have skills in many technologies, but my best skills are used to solve complex problems </p>

        <h3>Process Improvement</h3>
        <p>As an extension to problem solving, looking for ways to improve existing processes or even develop new ones has been a key motivator for me. My desire is to have people doing as little as humanly possible while ensuring results are better than expected. </p>

        <h3>Beer and Barbecue</h3>
        <p>As a young man, I spent a few years in Germany with the US Army. While there, I developed a taste for good beer which was difficult to satisfy when I returned to the US in 1988. Shortly after, I met a friend who was into brewing his own beer. I was hooked from the first batch. He stopped brewing within a couple of years, but I still brew today. In addition to brewing, I also am a National Certified Beer Judge and enjoy tasting beers brewed by others and offering possible tips to improve the end product.</p>
        <p>Never avoiding challenges, I also picked up barbecuing as a hobby. Not the gas grill that most people have, but low and slow smoking of meat that has tons of flavor.</p>
        <p>Lastly, my latest endeavor is home automation. As stated earlier, I want to have to do as little as possible, mostly because I forget things... </p>
